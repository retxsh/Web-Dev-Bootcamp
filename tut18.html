    <h3>Colors in CSS</h3>
    <div>
        There are three way to add color in CSS
    </div>
    <div>            
                <p id="PrimaryPara">
                The first method of defining the colour in the CSS is directly writing the particular colour name.
                </p>
            
                <p id="SecondaryPara">
                The second way of defining colour is with the help of ‘RGB,’ as shown below. The RGB colour range varies from 0 to 255.
                </p>
           
                <p id="ThirdPara">
                The third way is by giving hex colours. However, it is very rarely used.
